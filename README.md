It's a personal tool for counting some "tries" in WoW, who will use this
about me ? Whatever, if you do, just change the character names in a in the
`data` file (must be in the same directory as `main.py`) following theses
formatting conventions:
**Three columns separated with spaces:

- first column : name
- second column : ":"
- third column : "completion verb" ("todo" or "done")

data
>name_one : done
>name_two : done
>name_three : todo

You can also add characters using the script (it will be written).
Then just run main.py and follow the instrutions, they're rather explicit.
This does not checks all possible errors while asking for input and this
surelly will NOT work with a bad file formatting.
